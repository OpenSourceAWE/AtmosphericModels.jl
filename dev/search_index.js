Randomization is done by a white noise vector to give the wave numbers a random phase and amplitude. A wind field of 4050 x 100 x 500 points with 2 m resolution is pre-calculated. To obtain the 3D wind speed vector at any given position a 3rd order spline interpolation is used. To take the time dependency of the wind into account, the product of the simulation time and the average wind speed at the height of the kite is added to the x-coordinate before the wind vector lookup. The turbulent component of the wind field is periodic in all directions, because it is generated using reverse FFT.
