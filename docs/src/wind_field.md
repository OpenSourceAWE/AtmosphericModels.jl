## Wind Fields

### Wind shear, scenario Cabauw, The Netherlands
Wind data from Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI 2011) at the
inland location Cabauw, The Netherlands was used and the wind profile fitted, using
the power law according to the following equation:
$$
v_\mathrm{w} = v_\mathrm{w,ref}\left(\frac{z}{10~\mathrm{m}}\right)^{\mathrm{p}}
$$
where z is the height and p the power coefficient.

A coefficient **p = 0.234** was obtained, which is
significantly larger than for the location Valkenburg. This is to be expected because
Cabauw is a lot further away from the shore than Valkenburg.

### Wind turbulence, scenario Cabauw
A one year measurement time series from the wind measurement tower in Cabauw was used to calibrate
the wind speed, wind shear and wind turbulence of this scenario.

The relative turbulence intensity I, the ratio of the standard deviation of the wind speed
within 10 minute intervals and the 10 minute wind speed average ws calculated, based on
the Cabauw data set from Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute **KNMI (2011)**.
Three scenarios are chosen for the simulation: The average ground wind speed of
**3.483 m/s**, the wind speed for nominal power of **5.324 m/s** and the maximal wind speed
for operation without the need to depower the kite of **8.163 m/s**.

| $v_{w,g}$  | $I_{99}$ |$I_{197}$| Description      |
|:----------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-----------------|
|  3.483 m/s  |    8.5%  | 6.3%    |Average wind speed|
|  5.324 m/s  |    9.7%  | 7.2%    |Nominal wind speed|
|  8.163 m/s  |    9.8%  | 7.9%    |High wind speed   |

The reference height for the ground wind speed is 6m. The reason for choosing 6m instead of the standard height of 10m is that during the flight tests only a 6m mast was available.

A correction factor was used to adapt the turbulence from the IEC model to the measured values.
In `settings.yaml`, this line defines the correction factors: `rel_turbs:   [0.342, 0.465, 0.583]`.

As you see, in this scenario the turbulence increases with the average wind speed and decreases
with the height.

The turbulence is modelled in three dimensions, using the Mann model as described
by **Mann (1994)** and **Mann (1998)**. The resulting homogeneous velocity field is obtained
by a 3D FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) of the spectral tensor. Randomization is done by a white noise vector to give the wave numbers a random phase and amplitude.
A wind field of 4050 x 100 x 500 points with 2 m resolution is pre-calculated. To obtain the 3D wind speed vector at any given position a 3rd order spline interpolation is
used. To take the time dependency of the wind into account, the product of the simulation
time and the average wind speed at the height of the kite is added to the x-coordinate
before the wind vector lookup. The turbulent component of the wind field is periodic
in all directions, because it is generated using reverse FFT. The size of the wind field is
chosen such that the wind speed sequence repeats every 13.5 minutes at a wind speed of
10 m/s.
